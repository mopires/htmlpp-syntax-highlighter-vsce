# HTML++ Syntax highlight

Modern way to write HTML. The concept remains the same, but without the "< > </>", like Sass, but different.

So far HTML++ use single quote ' to set a value in an attribute (Ex: class='col-12'). In this extension you can use double quote on the attributes but it will return an error when you build.
